# co-prime_checker
A simple RUST program to check if two given numbers are co-prime or relatively prime

Two numbers are said to be co-prime or relatively prime if their GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) or HCF (Highest Common Factor) is 1

For example, 27 & 32 are co-prime because GCD(27,32) = 1 but 27 & 33 are not because GCD(27,33) = 3
